## Self-study: freeCodeCamp

### Introduction
Over the past few years, I've always been solving problems with web apps, always being in my JavaScript (and recently PHP Laravel) bubble and coming up with sub-optimal solutions (due to my lack of experience in other fields).

At the same time, I discovered that in the next two years on my education journey, I will be facing two programming languages I barely scratched the surface of: Python and Java. 

FreeCodeCamp offers courses in Python that are, well, free. But they also give freedom and diverse scoped projects, making it easier to focus & explore the programming language while having that euphoric moment once you've solved the challenge!

### Rules for myself
- I will not use Copilot / ChatGPT / any other AI tool to explain, interpret, write or otherwise tackle an issue.
- When searching the internet / SO, I will limit myself to syntax-related questions.
- I will not copy code outside of the FreeCodeCamp brief.
- I will only submit my code for testing when I'm absolutely sure I've solved the project. This is to prevent writing code for specific test cases and to keep code more resilient.
